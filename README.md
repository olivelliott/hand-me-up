## **Description**

A clothing re-sale application with a purpose that reduces the stigma of accepting low-cost clothing.

Sellers list their clothing for sale at a rate that just covers shipping. Buyers can shop from a selection of low-cost but trendy and modern clothing. Buyers have the option to make an additional donation to a partner charity of their choice when making a purchase.
